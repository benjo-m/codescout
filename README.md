# CodeScout

## Description  
CodeScout is a recruitment platform build with Angular and .NET. It allows recruiters to post projects with specific technologies, enabling them to attract candidates with the right skills. Job seekers can explore opportunities by filtering projects based on technology, company, and position, making the search process more efficient and tailored to their expertise.

Beyond traditional job matching, CodeScout serves as a stepping stone for individuals with little to no professional experience. By working on real-world projects, users can gain hands-on experience, build their resumes, and showcase their skills to potential employers. This creates a win-win environment where recruiters discover talented individuals, and job seekers gain practical experience that enhances their career prospects.

## Features  
- **Project Posting** – Recruiters can create and share projects with the required technologies.  
- **Job Filtering** – Users can search for projects by company, position, or technology to find relevant opportunities.  
- **Connections & Messaging** – Users can connect with others and send private messages.  
- **Profile Page** – Each user has a profile where recruiters and other users can see their completed projects, bio, and social links (LinkedIn, GitHub, Facebook, etc.).
